1. Data Preparation
You will need a dataset that contains transaction records, including whether each transaction was fraudulent or not. A popular dataset is the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset.

Steps:
Download the dataset.
Load and inspect the dataset.
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')

# Check the dataset structure
print(data.head())
print(data.info())
Features: The dataset has numerical features V1, V2, ..., V28, which are the result of a PCA transformation for privacy, along with Time (the time since the first transaction) and Amount (the transaction amount).
Target: The Class column indicates whether the transaction is fraud (1) or non-fraud (0).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before building the model, it's important to understand the data distribution and handle any imbalances.
# Check for class imbalance
print(data['Class'].value_counts())

# Visualize the class distribution
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.countplot(x='Class', data=data)
plt.show()
As expected, the dataset will be highly imbalanced since fraudulent transactions are rare.
3. Data Preprocessing
You need to prepare the data for modeling, including scaling the features, handling class imbalance, and splitting the data.
Scaling:
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Scaling the 'Amount' and 'Time' columns
scaler = StandardScaler()
data['scaled_amount'] = scaler.fit_transform(data['Amount'].values.reshape(-1, 1))
data['scaled_time'] = scaler.fit_transform(data['Time'].values.reshape(-1, 1))

# Drop original columns
data.drop(['Amount', 'Time'], axis=1, inplace=True)
Splitting the Data:
You can split the data into training and testing sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Features and target
X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = data['Class']

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y)
4. Handling Imbalanced Data
Since the data is imbalanced, you can use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the classes.
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_train_res, y_train_res = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
5. Building a Machine Learning Model
You can now build a machine learning model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost. We'll use Logistic Regression as an example.
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

# Build the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs', max_iter=1000, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_res, y_train_res)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
# Evaluation
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Accuracy: ", accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred))
6. Evaluating the Model
Use evaluation metrics that are more relevant to imbalanced datasets:

Confusion Matrix: To see how many frauds are caught and how many legitimate transactions are flagged incorrectly.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: These metrics are more meaningful than accuracy for imbalanced datasets.
ROC Curve: Plot the ROC curve to see the performance at different thresholds.
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, roc_curve

# Calculate the ROC AUC score
roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"ROC AUC Score: {roc_auc}")

# Plot the ROC curve
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1])
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, label=f'AUC = {roc_auc:.2f}')
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.show()
7. Improving the Model
Try Different Algorithms: Test Random Forest, XGBoost, or Gradient Boosting to see if they improve performance.
Feature Engineering: Create additional features (e.g., transaction frequency, cardholder location, etc.).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model hyperparameters.
8. Deploying the Model
Once the model is performing well, you can deploy it to production. In a real-world system, the model will need to run in real-time, handling incoming transactions and flagging suspicious ones for further investigation.
